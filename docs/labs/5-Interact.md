# Event Handlers and Listeners

(Deliverable – export the entire interactivity lab as a zip file when
you're done)

If you still feel uncomfortable with either the [ACM](4-ACM.html) or the [Intro to Java](2-JavaIntro.html)
Labs, you should go back and revisit what was done in each. Today we're
going to get you started on learning and additional topic events that
will allow us to add some dynamic content to our upcoming graphics
program.

## Old I/O Programs

Most of the programs you have created for COMP 51 and 53 have had a very
linear structure that was based on text input and output. While the
programs that you created were dynamic in that they asked the user for
input, the program would explicitly wait for users to type and press
enter before moving on. The program controlled when users could input
information. The *program* would run through its statements, and when it
reached the command to get input from the user, it would then wait for
the user to type in some piece of information. While it was waiting,
**the program would not be able to do anything**. This also happened
with the user, as they had to wait until the program told them it was
their turn. If a program had a ```cin``` statement, the program would stay
waiting there, until the user pressed the *Enter* key, at which time
your program was able to continue its execution. This *"either you or
the computer is in control"* is not typically the way we think about
software. Most modern software allows you to make decisions at any time.
For example, with a media player, if you click play, the media starts
playing, but you are also given a stop button, rewind, as well as other
features, that you can click on at any time. Rather than you or the
computer having sole control of the program at a certain time, modern
programs make it feel like we can take over control at any time, which
is great. The question is…how can they do this? To help explain how, we
need to understand the notion of an *event*.

## What's an event?

A **computer event** is a special "happening" that a program may find
important. A good real-life analogy is an unexpected real-life event
(like finding out that there is a flash sale at your favorite store). In
that case, you (or the computer) might be currently occupied with a
task. However, if you were to find out that there was an **event**, like
this flash sale, you may have to stop what you are doing, **handle the
event**, and then resume what you were doing. There are several
different computer events out there, which each program can decide how
to handle. Some examples of computer events are the mouse moving or a
keyboard key being pressed. When users move the mouse or press a key on
the keyboard, Java can be setup to immediately notify any active program
about that event. Just like with a flash sale, In order to receive that
information, you must sign up to receive that notification, which we'll
explain how to do in a bit.

You can find the starter files for this project by going to the starter
files section in Canvas, and looking for the **InteractivityLab.zip**.
Go ahead and import the project and open up *Ball.java* and run the
program as an applet. What you'll notice in the program is a very rough
animation of a ball bouncing horizontally. Once you finish this lab you
can think about how to make the ball bounce more cleanly off the window.

The ACM libraries have made it easy for you to subscribe to mouse event
notifications - one can subscribe by calling ```addMouseListeners()```. Once
that line is called, your program will be notified of all mouse events.
This is typically done towards the end of the run method, and only needs
to be done once. You can go ahead and call this method now in ```run```, but
BEFORE the ```animateBall()``` function, which is an infinite loop that is
taking care of moving the ball. If we make the call to
```addMouseListeners``` after ```animateBall```, it will never be called.

## The Five Mouse Events

By calling ```addMouseListeners```, the ACM conveniently sets you up to be
notified about five events, these are

```mousePressed``` – called when a mouse button shifts from not being
pressed to being pressed

```mouseReleased``` – called when a mouse button shifts from being pressed
to not pressed

```mouseClicked``` – called when a mouse button goes from not pressed, to
pressed, to not pressed with little to no movement when the mouse is
pressed.

```mouseEntered``` – called when a mouse cursor comes inside the bounds of
the program (the program window)

```mouseExited``` – called when a mouse cursor leaves the bounds of the
program

When we are notified of each of these events we need to decide how we
want the program to respond. For example, going back to our real world
event about the flash sale, if a flash sale started you need to choose
how you would handle that situation. Some of you may decide to ignore
the sale, others may check it out and buy everything you're interested
in, while others of you may tell your friends. How you handle the event
is up to you.

If we want the computer to do something special when an event happens,
we need to define a method that contains the code that responds to that
particular event. These are known as **event handlers**, because they
specify what code we want to execute when that event happens. In fact,
when I've mentioned before that Java notifies us about any of the events
listed above, what it really does is call the event method name listed
above for all objects that added themselves as a listener.

For this lab we will define our response like this: when user presses a
button, we will change the ball's color to a random color. To do this we
are going to write a definition for ```mousePressed```. To do that,
introduce the following method definition in your code:

```java
@Override
public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
    //code to tell the computer what to do when the mouse is pressed
}
```

It's useful to write the ```@Override``` label because it tells Java that
what you are doing is defining a special method that it should
recognize. If it doesn't recognize the method that you are trying to
define, it should raise an error (red squiggly). While providing
```@Override``` is optional, if you were to misspell ```mousePressed```, as
```musePressed``` for example, Java would have no way of knowing whether you
intended that method to be an event handler or if you writing a program
about pressing muses. All the mouse events are ```public``` because they are
being called by Java classes that are foreign to our program. Let's have
our event handler set the color of the ball to a new random color. We
are going to use a convenience function written using the
```RandomGenerator``` class. Go ahead and set the color on the ball inside
the ```mousePressed``` method. Inside the parenthesis of the ```setColor```
method for the ball, write ```rgen.nextColor()```, which will provide us
with a randomly generated color each time the mouse is pressed.

```java
ball.setColor(rgen.nextColor());
```

After you make this change, go ahead and run the program. Make sure that
as the ball is moving, you click on the mouse with fury. Notice the
color of the ball is randomly changing every time you click the mouse.
If we want to make changes to any objects, they must be listed as
instance variables (like ```ball``` is). Remember that "Java" is the one
calling this method, and it has no clue of what information you'll need.
If you need to change a value or object inside a mouse handler, you need
to make sure that object is listed as an instance variable, otherwise
you won't be able to make the necessary changes. Before you move on,
make sure that you are able to change the colors.

### The MouseEvent parameter

Each of these mouse events has a parameter object that accompanies the
event. That object, which is of type ```MouseEvent```, carries useful
information about the state the mouse was in when the event occurred.
For example, if the mouse was pressed, what was the coordinate at where
the mouse was pressed? Which button on the mouse was pressed? This
parameter of type ```MouseEvent``` is commonly named ```e``` to stand for the
event. To make our program more exciting, let's move the ball to where
our mouse location is. Inside of the ```mousePressed``` function, add a call
to ```ball```'s ```setLocation```. To set the location, we need to provide an
```x``` and a ```y```**.** We will not move the ```x``` in this case, but just the
```y``` coordinate. To keep the horizontal movement, ask the ball for its x
location by calling ```getX()``` on the ball and then just set it back
reflexively as its x location again. To get the y, however, rather than
calling ```getY``` on the ball, we are going to call ```getY``` on the
```MouseEvent```, which will return to us the y coordinate of where the
mouse was pressed. In your ```mousePressed``` function the line you added
should look like this…

![](lab5media/media/image1.png)

Run the program again and make sure to click in a couple of different
areas. Notice that our ```mousePressed``` method is relatively short and
without loops. We are doing some small operations which allows us to
feel like the ball is immediately responding and then continuing back to
moving from side to side. If you'd like the ball to be placed in the
center of where the mouse cursor is, you'll have to do a little bit of
math on the y coordinate to make that happen, but we'll leave that for
later.

Being able to retrieve information about the cursor location when the
mouse is clicked is nice, because we can use that information to make
some simple decisions as well. Let's combine the information about the
mouse, along with another method called ```getElementAt```, which will
return to us a ```GObject``` at a specific coordinate if one is there. If
not, it will return ```null```. Let's use ```getElementAt``` to only change the
color of the ball when we actually click on the ball, which would mean
that if we call ```getElementAt``` and pass in the coordinates for the
```mousePressed``` event, ```getElementAt``` can detect whether or not we
clicked on the ball. To do this, let's change our ```mousePressed``` method
to have an ```if``` statement where we check if the element at the mouse
coordinates is in fact, the ball, if it is, then we'll change the color.
Otherwise, we'll move it to where our mouse cursor is. The tricky part
is generating the condition for the ```if``` statement here which should be
something like ```if(getElementAt(e.getX(), e.getY()) == ball)```, which
essentially says, is the ```x``` and ```y``` coordinates of where I pressed the
mouse on top of the ball? If so, change the color and otherwise set the
ball's location. Once you make the changes, test it again, making sure
that you understand how ```getElementAt``` works here. We can compare or use
the double equals because as you'll remember, we are dealing with
pointers, so it will check to see if the objects are the same object in
this situation by comparing address locations.

### Understanding when all events are called.

The easiest way for us to understand how and when all of the mouse
events are called is to do one of my favorite things when I'm first
learning to program in a language, which is, **print a bunch of stuff**.
For this part, what we are going to do is override all of the mouse
events by writing method definitions for all five mouse events so far.
In every method definition, make a ```System.out.println()``` call with a
unique message in each method – things like "mouse pressed" for the
```mousePressed``` method. All of the methods take the same ```MouseEvent e```
parameter, so you can leverage that and change your code a bit for each
method. Once you do that, run the java applet and click once. Notice how
many events get generated\! You can also try to see if you can get it so
that ```mouseClicked``` is not generated.

## Mouse Motion Events:

While this is all great and everything, what makes programs truly
dynamic is moving the mouse and dragging. We haven't talked about calls
like moving the mouse.

That is because those events have been split off from the five we've
just discussed in the traditional java sense, they are categorized as
```MouseMotion``` events. In standard Java, to listen to these events we
would have to register ourselves as a ```MouseMotionListener``` in addition
to a ```MouseListener```. Nonetheless, the ACM library makes it easy on us.
Because we called ```addMouseListeners()```, this is a convenience program
written by ```GraphicsProgram``` that allows us to also receive
notifications for the following two events:

```mouseMoved``` – called whenever the mouse is moved on the screen and no
buttons are pressed

```mouseDragged``` – called whenever the mouse is moved on the screen and a
button is pressed

Go ahead and use the ```println``` statements like you did in the previous
portion to handle these two events, which both also take in the
```MouseEvent e``` as a parameter. Notice how so many events are being
generated\! It's not just that one mouse movement event is being
generated for when you move the mouse, but java is continually spamming
you with event notifications even during what you would consider to be
one movement. With so many event notifications, we need to be careful
with how we handle those events, and want to avoid taxing the computer
during that method call. We will talk about how to deal with dragging in
a bit.

## The Rubber Band

To start us off with dealing with these movements, let's do a code
example that really helps us to understand how dynamic our programs can
become by doing something as simple as working with a line and dragging
it. Go ahead and open up your *RubberBand.java*, which looks almost
identical to *Ball.java* when it was first created, except that there is
no code in ```run()```. This is because all of the action here will
generated when the user clicks and drags the mouse. The first thing we
will do is call ```addMouseListeners()```, to allow ```RubberBand``` to receive
notifications about the mouse events. In this situation we are going to
handle two events, when the user first presses a mouse button, and when
the user drags. Write a method for ```mousePressed``` that will create a new
```GLine``` and then add it to the screen. We want to have access to that
line later on, so an important step here is to create an **instance**
variable (not local variable) of type ```GLine``` (we'll call the instance
variable ```newLine```), after the constants. Inside of ```mousePressed```,
assign your newly created ```GLine``` to the instance variable ```newLine```.
Remember that the parameters for a new ```GLine``` are ```x1, y1, x2, y2```. We
need to provide actual values there, so for this example, let's create a
line with zero length. We can do this by passing in the parameter for
where the mouse button was clicked to each of the four parameters
```(e.getX(), e.getY(), e.getX(), e.getY())```. Once we create the ```GLine```
and ```add``` it to screen, if we were to run the program, we would see
nothing happen if we were to click. The screen will still be empty.

The trick that we are going to add here is what we do on dragging. Go
ahead and define the ```mouseDragged(MouseEvent e)``` method. When we drag,
we are going to change one of the line's endpoints to reflect the new
position of the mouse cursor. This can be done by calling ```GLine```'s
inbuilt function ```setEndPoint``` which takes in an ```x``` and a ```y```
parameter. We can get the ```**x```** and ```**y```** from the ```MouseEvent```.
Once you write this correctly you should be able to click and then drag,
and you will see a line that is growing and shrinking as long as you
keep the mouse down, like if you were playing with a rubber band. Once
you release the button, you are no longer able to change anything about
the line, with the code that we have. Now, every time that we press the
mouse button, we create a new line, this means that our users can create
a multitude of lines to form a picture. Go ahead and make a small
picture and show me your proud artistic accomplishment before you
continue.

## Real Dragging

We're almost there and then you can work on getting everything going\!
Before we continue, we have to do one more thing, which is to talk about
dragging. Let's open up the *Dragging.java* file. This program has two
objects, an oval and a rectangle, on the screen. If you look at the
code, I've already written the method definitions for the three mouse
events, as well as call ```addMouseListeners``` for you here. What you have
to do is concentrate on getting the dragging to work properly. The first
thing that people tend to do from a dragging standpoint, is to simply
override mouse dragged by getting the location of the object and
possibly calling ```setLocatio```n. Go ahead and try to do this first. Add
these two lines to the ```mouseDragged``` event handler and then run the
program.

```java
toDrag = getElementAt(e.getX(), e.getY());
toDrag.setLocation(e.getX(), e.getY());
```

One thing you'll notice is a lot of null pointer exceptions as well as
the code not working too well. Try **dragging upwards and to the left**
instead of downwards and to the right, you may notice that one feels
more like it's dragging then the other. Two things can happen here.
Let's deal with the first one, which is a *null pointer exception*.
This can happen if we tend to click in an area where an object is not
present. If we ever do this and call ```getElementAt```, ```getElementAt```
returns ```null```. This means that if we try to call say ```setLocation``` on
```null```, we'll get a null pointer exception raised. Java is nice in that
it continues to try to run the program and recover afterwards, but
you'll notice this happen a lot. An easy way for us to stop generating
the exceptions is to add an ```if``` statement after our ```getElementAt```. We
only want to set the location of ```toDrag``` if in fact, ```toDrag``` is not
```null```. Otherwise, we are trying to set the location of a *null* object.
Go ahead and add an **if** statement to only call ```setLocation``` on
```toDrag``` if ```toDrag``` is not null and then run the program again
(***Ctrl-F11***). What you'll notice now is that no more exceptions are
being generated but the behavior is pretty much the same - we can't drag
upwards and to the left. The reason for this is what happens with
```setLocation```. Remember that here ```setLocation``` is being called on the
upper-left hand corner of the object, which could make it so that once
we call a drag event, the mouse cursor is already outside the bounds of
the object, and so it is not on top of an object anymore. One easy fix
that we can use is to change our ```setLocation``` so that we set the
location to be the center of the object. Thus rather than say
```setLocation (x, y)``` we need to subtract half of the shape's width and
height from x and y, which are defined as ```SHAPE_SIZE```. Go ahead and
make that change now and re-run the applet.

Now it starts to feel a little better\! There are still a couple of
things that are off. One of the big ones that can occur is when you drag
the blue oval over the green square, and if you pay close attention,
you'll notice that you leave the blue oval behind and start dragging
the green square. Another one that happens is if you start with your
mouse clicked somewhere away from one of the two objects and while the
mouse button is down, you move into one of the shapes. You'll notice
that you'll immediately start to move it. This happens because if you
notice the only event where we are doing anything significant is in
```mouseDragged```. This means that it's only handling messages when the
mouse is down. What we really want to do is instead, keep track of if we
started initially by pressing the mouse button when we were on top of an
object. If so, we should set that object to be the one that we drag.
Then in our ```mouseDragged```, we can continue to drag the object that we
clicked on. Let's change our code so that the ```getElementAt``` happens in
```mousePressed``` instead of in ```mouseDragged```, and re-run the program.
That will allow us to drag the same object everywhere, the one that we
initially pressed the mouse button on. Once you try to move everything
around, you can notice that everything is working more like we expect.

The last thing we want to eliminate is the jumpiness that happens when
we barely click on one of the corners. To make this more evident, let's
go ahead and change ```SHAPE_SIZE``` to be ```300``` so that we have a large
Circle and oval and run the program again. Slowly drag the blue oval
from its edge, and you'll notice the oval almost immediately jump to its
center. In reality, what we want is not for it to jump like this but if
we grab the oval from one of the edges and move, we really want it to
move however much the mouse moved.

To do this, what we need to do is keep track of that the mouse has moved
between ```mouseDragged``` events, so we are going to introduce two instance
variables, ```lastX``` and ```lastY```. Go ahead and add those into the
variables up top. Then we will set the ```lastX``` and ```lastY``` in
```mousePressed```. You can set those to the mouse coordinates from
```MouseEvent e```.

Now what we want is that each time ```mouseDragged``` is called, we want to
use the current coordinates and the last known coordinates of the mouse
to measure how far it has traveled. This will allow us to know how much
and in which direction the mouse has moved. If we know the direction and
how much the mouse has moved by, rather than call ```setLocation``` on the
object, we can use those calculations to figure out how much to ```move```
the object by in the x and y direction. Then after moving the object,
the last thing we want to do in ```mouseDragged``` is to update the last
known coordinates for the mouse cursor to be the current ones. We'll
leave it as an exercise to use your neighbors and others to figure out
the code that should be in ```mousePressed``` and ```mouseDragged``` (your hint
is that ```mousePressed``` should have 3 lines of code and ```mouseDragged```
should have 4-5 lines of code). You could do something nice like set
```toDrag``` to be ```null``` in ```mouseReleased```, but in this situation it's not
needed.

At this point you can submit the project, by submitting just the java
files via canvas.

# Bonus: Getting the object to bounce correctly

Coming back to the bouncing ball, one thing we should be aware of for a
ball is where ```getX``` and ```getY``` get their coordinates from, which is the
upper-left hand corner of any object.

![](lab5media/media/image2.png)

Remember that calling ```getX``` and ```getY``` will get us that upper left
corner

So if we want to check to see if the ball has bounced on say the right
edge, we need to include in our calculations the width of the ball to
check to see if it has reached the edge of the screen. By including the
width, we can make sure that we can keep the ball on the screen. In
addition to modifying the code so that it bounces off more clearly, you
can also add a ```yVelocity```, which should only be flipped (like we do
with the ```xVelocity```, when we reach the top or the bottom of the screen.
It's best to create a new method to check the vertical bounds and make
that separate than the horizontal bounds, so that way it is easier to
change the velocity of x or y. Once we add the ```yVelocity```, we should be
able to make what looks like a bouncing ball that bounces off the
screen. Similar to this figure below.

![](lab5media/media/image3.png)

You should have enough now to make something somewhat interesting. Use
the ```mouseMoved``` event handler to move a rectangle like a paddle, and
then use ```getElementAt``` to see if you ever hit that other object. Good
luck\!
