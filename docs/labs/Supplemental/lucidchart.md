# Lucid Charts

Before getting familiar with this, keep in mind that the main focus of the course will be **PLANTUML**.
This is just some additional information that might be helpful for your future projects and classes.
Here I would like to introduce the [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com) online software.
Here are some functionalities of it:

- *Easily style shapes*

- *Organizing diagrams with containers*

- *Create clean diagrams*

- *And most importantly, collaborate with teammates*
Please follow the following animation for setting it up. Good luck!

After the log in this window will show up on the screen

The shortest way of creating a new project is using the **New** button. There you will have 2 options

I would suggest to use a blank document if you are planning to create UML diagrams.
On the left side, the second button will take you there directly

However, for different projects and chart types you can go to the templates option which will open
many different kinds of graphs that might be useful for any project.

**NOTE: Lucid chart can be widely used and have many different functionalities, however,
when it comes to UML diagrams, PlantUML is stronger and easier to use once you
get used to the syntax of it.
Lucid Charts can be used for many other purposes as well but I would not consider it as powerful as PlantUML**
