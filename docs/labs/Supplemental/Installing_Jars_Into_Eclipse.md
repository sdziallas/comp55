# How to Add the ACM.jar to Your Build Path

If you wish to use the ACM library, it is not as simple as doing a `#include "acm.jar"`.
In order to use the library, you have to manually add it.

## Instructions

1. Import the *acm.jar* into your program (the **IntroACMLab.zip**)
2. Right click your project
3. Click the Properties tab towards the button
4. Click on ***Java Build Path***
5. Click the ***Add JARs...*** button
6. Locate the JAR file and double-click it
7. Click ***Apply and Close*** to enable the just added JAR file
8. Try to run your code

Note: In the gif, there is an error in the console in Eclipse. This is due to how
I tried to run the program without the JAR file in my build path.
After enabling the JAR, I am able to run my program without any errors
